Use the dataset called `example.db`. In this db use the table `sales` to find out the total sales for Women's and Men's clothing stores across years.

```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y',sales_month) as sales_year
,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' 
          then sales 
          end) as womens_sales
,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Men''s clothing stores' 
          then sales 
          end) as mens_sales
FROM sales
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
 ,'Women''s clothing stores')
GROUP BY 1
;
